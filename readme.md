# Buggy App

A simple todo application, deliberately filled with bugs for testing purposes.
The app consists of a fake backend server that stores the todo's and an angular 20 frontend

## Features

- Add todo
- Delete todo
- Mark todo as completed
- Filter todos by status
- Intentionally buggy behaviors for testing

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jordycap/buggy-app.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```
3. Run the frontend:

## Unknown Bugs
